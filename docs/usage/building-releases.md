The `BUILD` pipeline collates a numbered 'release' by extracting and building the assets required to deploy from source control. This can then be used later to deploy to any number of environments using the exact same, unchanged assets.

The `BUILD` job triggers automatically when any changes are made in the associated repo, including when `EXPORT` completes (unless no changes were found).

To monitor:

**Azure DevOps:**
1) Navigate to the **Pipelines** area of your AzDO project.
2) Select the **All** tab and navigate to the folder with the same name as your repo. (If you only have one repo, this will be the same as your project name by default.)
3) Select the `BUILD` pipeline and then select an instance of the job.
4) The view will switch automatically to show progress. Wait until it is shown as successful.

**GitHub Actions:**
1) Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your repository.
2) Select the **BUILD** workflow from the left panel.
3) Select the running workflow run. Wait until it is shown as successful (green checkmark).

What happens:

- Solution(s) are packed from the folders in source control at `solutions/uniquename` using PAC solution pack. A managed solution is generated and added to the build assets.
- If you've configured any hook extensions in `alm-config.psd1`, these will be executed and can add to the build steps and the assets.
- Any additional paths configured in `assets` will be copied to the build assets.
- The configuration and scripts for the deployment process are also copied to the build assets to ensure that everything is frozen in time.

What to do next:

- The `DEPLOY-<branchname>` pipeline triggers automatically if the job completes successfully.
